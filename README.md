# Staking Protocol

Welcome to the Staking Protocol repository. This project is a staking smart contract with the ability to stake ERC20 and ERC721 tokens with safe transfer.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a secure and efficient staking protocol for ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. The protocol is implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, using the Solidity programming language.

## Key Components

- **contracts**: This directory contains the Solidity smart contract files for the staking protocol.

- **migrations**: This directory contains the migration scripts for deploying the smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain.

- **test**: This directory contains the test scripts for testing the smart contracts.

- **truffle-config.js**: This file contains the configuration for the Truffle development environment.

- **package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies.

- **Staking Protocol.pdf**: This file contains a detailed description of the staking protocol.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required Node.js packages using `npm install`. You can then compile the smart contracts using `truffle compile`, and deploy them to the Ethereum blockchain using `truffle migrate`.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and the smart contracts should not be used for actual staking without further testing and validation.
